This repository contains the implementation of ARDiff: an equivalence checking framework that allows scaling symbolic-execution-based equivalence checking for cases that consider two subsequent versions of a program. 

It includes:
* The implementation of ARDiff abstraction-refinement approach ("ARDiff: Scaling Program Equivalence Checking via Iterative Abstraction and Refinement of Common Code", ESEC/FSE, 2020)
* An implementation of DSE -- a baseline equivalence checking technique ("Differential Symbolic Execution", FSE, 2008)
* An implementation of IMP-S -- a baseline equivalence checking technique ("Regression Verification using Impact Summaries", SPIN, 2013)

## Installing
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 is required.

Clone the repository:
````yaml
git clone https://github.com/resess/ARDiff.git
````

ARDiff has dependencies on JPF-core, JPF-Symbc Z3-solver. We included all dependencies in the tool. 

### JPF
Pre-built versions of [JPF-Symbc](https://github.com/SymbolicPathFinder/jpf-symbc). and [JPF-core](https://https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core) are included in the project under the folder jpf-git.

You need to create in your home directory a .jpf directory.

On Linux/OSX:

````yaml
mkdir ~/.jpf
````

On Windows:
````yaml
mkdir %UserProfile%/.jpf
````

Next, inside the .jpf directory, you need to include a file name "site.properties" with the following content:

````yaml
jpf-core = /.../path-to-ARDiff_Equiv_Checking-folder/Implementation/jpf-git/jpf-core
jpf-symbc = /.../path-to-ARDiff_Equiv_Checking-folder/Implementation/jpf-git/jpf-symbc
extensions = ${jpf-core},${jpf-symbc}
````

### Z3
For checking the equivalence of symbolic summaries, the Z3 constraint solver is used. 

The Z3 library files needed by JPF-symbc for Unix and Windows are provided in our Implementation directory (under jpf-git/jpf-symbc/lib) and must be included in the PATH (Windows) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (OSX) environnment variable. For example:

````yaml
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/.../path-to-ARDiff_Equiv_Checking-folder/Implementation/jpf-git/jpf-symbc/lib"
````

You can refer to [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) for more information or to build Z3 yourself.

## Setup

The .jar file to run the framework is provided in:
```yaml
/.../path-to-ARDiff_Equiv_Checking-folder/Implementation/target/artifacts/Implementation_jar/Implementation.jar
```

The project can also be opened as a Maven project in an IDE in order to change/update the source code. The main class is Runner.Runner

## Usage
You should run the tool from the ARDiff_Equiv_Checking/Implementation folder:
```yaml
cd /.../path-to-ARDiff_Equiv_Checking-folder/Implementation/

java -jar target/artifacts/Implementation_jar/Implementation.jar --path1 path/to/the/first/method --path2 path/to/the/second/method --tool ToolName --t timeout --bound LoopBoundLimit --minint Integer --maxint Integer --mindouble Double --maxdouble Double
```
For OSX/Linux users, if you are running into some issues indicating "no libz3java in java.library.path", 
try adding Z3 directory ("jpf-git/jpf-symbc/lib") to "java.library.path":

```yaml
java -Djava.library.path=jpf-git/jpf-symbc/lib -jar target/artifacts/Implementation_jar/Implementation.jar --path1 path/to/the/first/method --path2 path/to/the/second/method --tool ToolName --t timeout --bound LoopBoundLimit --minint Integer --maxint Integer --mindouble Double --maxdouble Double
```

There are 9 arguments for configuring the framework: --path1 and --path2 are mandatory and the other eight are optional. 

You need to give the paths to two (compilable) Java classes (with different names), each containing one of the target methods.

- Note that the signature (i.e the name and the input parameters) and the return type must be the same for the two methods.

- If the classes contain more than one method, the first method is considered as the target method for equivalence checking. 

- The final result and time are shown in the terminal. **Extra information from running the tools will be stored in the directory of --path1. In particular, the final result is stored under path1/outputs**

You can also choose the tool, the bound limit to unroll loops in JPF-symbc and min and max values for integers and doubles. 

You can choose the timeout in milliseconds. This timeout is for constraint solving in both JPF-symbc and Z3, it is not an overall timeout for the tool. 

If you want to stop the tool after t seconds, for example 5, you can use any timeout mechanism.
On Linux or OSX for instance, the Linux timeout command:  

```yaml
timeout 5 java -jar target/artifacts/Implementation_jar/Implementation.jar --path1 path/to/the/first/method --path2 path/to/the/second/method --tool ToolName  --t timeout --bound LoopBoundLimit --minint Integer --maxint Integer --mindouble Double --maxdouble Double
```
You might need to install first "coreutils". 

For  OSX users :
```yaml
brew install coreutils
```

For  Linux users :
```yaml
apt-get install coreutils
```

On Windows, you can use the  START-TIMEOUT builtins combination or other timeout tools, for example [this one](https://github.com/pshved/timeout).


To obtain the overall time taken by the tool, in addition to the detailed times (in milisecond) we provide, you can also use timing mechanisms such as the Linux time command which gives you the CPU runtime of the process:
```yaml
time java -jar target/artifacts/Implementation_jar/Implementation.jar --path1 path/to/the/first/method --path2 path/to/the/second/method --tool ToolName  --t timeout --bound LoopBoundLimit --minint Integer --maxint Integer --mindouble Double --maxdouble Double
```

## Example
Executing the following command (on OSX) runs ARDiff on the example "Airy/MAX/Eq". 
```yaml
time timeout 300 java -jar target/artifacts/Implementation_jar/Implementation.jar --path1 ../benchmarks/Airy/MAX/Eq/oldV.java --path2 ../benchmarks/Airy/MAX/Eq/newV.java --tool A 
```

## Benchmark 
You can find our dataset here:
```yaml
/.../path-to-ARDiff_Equiv_Checking-folder/benchmarks/
```
## Running ARDiff on Our Benchmark
You can run each pair of methods in the benchmark individually (as described above) or run all of them in sequence by running the script we provided.

There are three scripts for running the tool on the benchmark, one for each operating system.

Note, in terms of system requirements, running benchmarks need at least 16 GB memory and the expected runtime is 10-14 hrs. 

- 16GB is a safe bound to ensure symbolic execution and the SMT solver can handle complex examples. This requirement can be easily modified by changing the -Xms parameter in the scripts, however we can not guarantee that you will obtain the same results (as some cases might become UNKNOWN)

For example, the following script is for Linux users:
```yaml
cd /.../path-to-ARDiff_Equiv_Checking-folder/Implementation/
sh RunningBenchmarksOnLinux.sh
```
OSX users should use RunningBenchmarksOnMac.sh.

The script runs DSE, IMP-S, and ARDiff on each Equivalent and Non-Equivalent pairs of methods for each benchmark.
